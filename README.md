# Doctor-Investigation-Assistance-Fuzzy-Logic-Inference-System


This is an imaginary fuzzy inference system to assist doctor in making decision on whether a patient should be transferred to a hospital for further emergency investigations. Body temperature and the severity of a headache are two consequential parameters of inputs that directly modify the outcome of the fuzzy inference system. The outcome is generated based on the pre-defined rules calculated by the system designer.
